**Virtual Assistant**
Overview
This Virtual Assistant is a Python-based AI-enabled application designed to perform a variety of tasks efficiently using voice commands. It combines speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies to interact with users and execute commands seamlessly.

Features
Speech Recognition:

Converts user voice input to text using the speech_recognition library.
Text-to-Speech (TTS):

Responds to commands with a natural-sounding voice using pyttsx3.
Task Automation:

Opens websites like YouTube, Google, and custom URLs in Chrome.
Launches or closes applications like WhatsApp Desktop.
Searches information on Wikipedia or performs calculations using WolframAlpha.
Closes all running applications at once.
OpenAI Integration:

Uses GPT models to generate intelligent conversational responses for complex queries.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and APIs:
pyttsx3: Text-to-speech conversion
speech_recognition: Speech input processing
wikipedia: Fetching summaries from Wikipedia
wolframalpha: For mathematical and scientific queries
openai: AI-powered conversational support
webbrowser: For opening websites and searches
os and subprocess: System-level task management
